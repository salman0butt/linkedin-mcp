M09 final PR #14 feature head: `c6ef52f5` (abbreviated, as reported), exact CI `40218390770` — SUCCESS.
Verified M08 final feature CI: `40120392598` at `b2c1ad9abec69ec05f1a18024f7abebffb9d007a` — SUCCESS.
Verified M08 post-merge main CI: `40120555718` at `4b56a8411eed258ad2e2832b1796031288498a0e` — SUCCESS, frozen install, 988/988 tests across 88 suites, format, lint, typecheck and build.

## Authority and restrictions

M06 Job Search is COMPLETE: PR #9 squash-merged at `0ff384ae5deb03b504259dc3f5519c8209c3e8f8`, post-merge main CI `40077809706` passed. Independent M06.6 whole-branch review closed all verified Critical/Important findings. Both M05 and M06 preserve the lack of a configured external/partner discovery provider; no live LinkedIn Talent entitlement is claimed.

M07 Job Intelligence is COMPLETE: PR #10 squash-merged at `80b563293e48afd878158bcd2ee40553997ecb42`, exact feature-head CI `40089032116` and exact post-merge main CI `40089200098` passed 902 tests across 83 files. Independent whole-branch M07.7 security/correctness reviewer signed off with zero unresolved Critical/Important findings. Read-only `linkedin.jobs.analyze` and `linkedin.jobs.compare` are locally available over STDIO and HTTP. Caller snapshots remain unverified; no applicant legal eligibility, employer verification, Talent entitlement or application submission is inferred.

M08 Article Authoring Engine is COMPLETE: PR #12 exact feature `b2c1ad9abec69ec05f1a18024f7abebffb9d007a` CI `40120392598` SUCCESS, squash merge `4b56a8411eed258ad2e2832b1796031288498a0e`, post-merge main CI `40120555718` SUCCESS with 988 tests across 88 suites. Independent audit unresolved Critical=0 Important=0. `article.draft` is verified **LOCAL_ONLY**: user sources are unverified; project persistence is opt-in STDIO-private and inaccessible over HTTP. This milestone did **not** enable native LinkedIn article publication.

M09 **local preparation is VERIFIED and MERGED**: the pure handoff passed 11/11 adversarial tests, the typed `linkedin.article.native.handoff` MCP tool passed 4/4 focused tests and built STDIO/HTTP checks passed. Two independently re-reviewed security fixes (URL credential aliases and HTTP response bounds) closed at **Critical=0, Important=0** across complementary reviewer scopes. Prime's full local Node24 gates passed **1,023/1,023 in 90 suites**. PR #14 final feature-head CI `40218390770` succeeded at `c6ef52f5`; it was squash-merged to `main` `073bf180823292dccf5719a0d55be03983705168`, whose exact push CI `40218532046` **SUCCESS**. The local handoff's verified state does **not** imply remote native publishing or a complete M09 milestone.

Actual native LinkedIn article publishing remains **BLOCKED/UNAVAILABLE**: the documented Posts API `content.article` produces a URL/link-preview post, not a native long-form editor document; no authorized native editor API or approved browser provider is configured. Do not automate LinkedIn's browser without authorization, bypass challenges, treat author review as publication approval, or advertise remote publication from the local handoff.

Exact next work: **Create the docs-only verified-handoff closeout PR from `docs/m09-manual-handoff-closeout` and verify its exact-head CI.** M10.0 sourced research planning is the next independent roadmap activity after that checkpoint; M09.P stays blocked pending legitimate native publication authorization.
